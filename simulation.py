    This function calculates the pedigree probability after a number of iterations. This corresponds to Pr(Hkn=hkn).
    This probability is only calculated once for a given pedigree. The result is stored in the simulation object.
    The calculation is performed on the rearranged pedigree, where the suspect is the root node.
    During each iteration, the haplotypes of the unknown individuals are predicted based on the haplotypes
    of the surrounding known individuals, and the given mutation rates.

    The order in which the unknown individuals are processed is determined by the level order traversal
    of the rearranged pedigree. This means that the (unknown) children of the suspect are processed first,
    then the (unknown) children of the children, and so on. For each unknown individual, the haplotype of its
    father (parent node) is used to predict its own haplotype.

    After all unknown individuals have been processed, the pedigree probability is calculated. This is done by
    multiplying the probabilities of the individual edges in the rearranged pedigree that were not used to predict
    the haplotypes of the unknown individuals. An edge is the connection between a parent and a child in the pedigree.
    The probability of an edge is the probability of the child's haplotype given the parent's haplotype.
    The probability of an edge is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the child's alleles given the parent's
    alleles. The probability of an allele is calculated by the mutation rate of the allele's marker.
